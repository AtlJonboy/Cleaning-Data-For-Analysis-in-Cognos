This is the read me.
the original source file can be located here.
https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/T3iZyjwN9ifjS-B0JaYVgw/survey-data-updated%205.csv
Once the file is local, rename the file to 'survey_data_updated 5.csv'
The python files included will scrub the data out of the source file.

a pdf file is included for seeing the cognos output.  

Worth noting, i still need to develop code that will clean the data one step further by taking into account common misplellings and natural colloquialisms for varying servies.

also worth noting.  the code in python assumes that the source directory is c:/PythonCode  to be run locally
